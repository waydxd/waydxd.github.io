# About Me

Hi, I'm Jenson — a Computer Science undergraduate at HKUST (2022–2026) who lives in the computer more than in the real world.

I'm a shy Linux user (I no longer use Arch btw), constantly hopping between distros and obsessively tweaking my desktop environment until it's *just right*.

> *A computer is like air conditioning – it becomes useless when you open Windows.* — Linus Torvalds

I'm passionate about full-stack development — I love crafting frontends just as much as building robust backend systems. AI fascinates me, though I have a love-hate relationship with the math behind it (currently suffering through those "optional" math courses I chose to take).

## 🎧 Beyond Code

- Not a sports person at all.
- Obsessed with indie‑pop — especially old Grimes tracks (Miss Anthropocene is good tho), Pearly Drops, Magdalena Bay...
- Sometimes I drift into Lorde’s discography.
- Trying to treasure the older Grimes era. 請格萊美鼠再出一張像藝術天使般高質的專輯 🙏
- Still figuring myself out, just like everyone else.
