# About Me

Hi, I’m Jenson — a Comp Sci UG at HKUST (2022–2026) who lives in the computer more than in the real world.  
I’m a shy Linux enjoyer (I no longer use Arch btw), constantly hopping between distros and obsessively tweaking my desktop environment until it’s *just right*.  
> *A computer is like air conditioning – it becomes useless when you open Windows.* -- Linus Torvald

I’m into full‑stack development — I love tweaking frontends just as much as building backend systems. AI fascinates me, but I hate math, so now I’m suffering through the math courses (which I could have chosen not to take) in the CS curriculum.

# 🎧 Hobbies & Random Facts
- Not a sports person at all.  
- Obsessed with indie‑pop — especially old Grimes tracks (Miss Anthropocene is good tho), Pearly Drops, Magdalena Bay... 
- Sometimes I drift into Lorde’s discography.  
- Trying to treasure the older Grimes era. 請格萊美鼠再出一張像藝術天使般高質的專輯 🙏 
- Still figuring myself out, just like everyone else.
