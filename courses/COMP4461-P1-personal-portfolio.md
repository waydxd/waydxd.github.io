### üß† Project Description & Goal

Our team was tasked with an imaginative yet meaningful challenge: to re-envision HKUST as an inclusive and welcoming environment for visiting students from Atlantis, an aquatic civilization with distinct physiological and cultural needs. These students, envisioned as shark-like beings with legs, require water to breathe and communicate effectively, presenting unique challenges for their integration into a terrestrial campus. Our goal was to design innovative, empathetic, and practical solutions to support their academic, social, and daily life at HKUST, fostering a sense of belonging and mutual understanding.

To kickstart the process, our team‚ÄîGroup 5‚Äîcollaborated on a **comprehensive mindmap** to explore the needs, challenges, and potential solutions for these aquatic visitors. This brainstorming phase was critical in shaping our approach, allowing us to think creatively about cross-species inclusion.

### ‚ú¥Ô∏è POV Statement 1  
**Atlantis students need a more inclusive campus culture to fully engage in and enjoy their academic and social experiences at HKUST.**

To address this need, I proposed the creation of a new Common Core course, **OCES 1000: Cross-Species Cultural Integration and Environmental Adaptation**. This course aims to bridge the gap between human and aquatic students by fostering mutual understanding and collaboration. The curriculum includes:  
- **Cultural and Species Diversity**: Exploring the unique traditions, values, and histories of Atlantis students to promote inclusivity.  
- **Cross-Environment Communication**: Teaching methods for effective communication between water-dependent and air-breathing beings, including non-verbal and technology-assisted strategies.  
- **Environmental Adaptation Strategies**: Equipping students with tools to navigate unfamiliar environments, such as water-based spaces for Atlantis students or air-conditioned areas for humans.  
- **Conflict Resolution and Cooperation**: Practicing techniques to address misunderstandings and build teamwork across species.  
- **Cultural Exchange**: Encouraging students to share traditions through events like underwater storytelling or terrestrial festivals.  
- **Empathy and Respect**: Fostering a campus culture rooted in mutual respect and understanding.  
- **Collaborative Projects**: Engaging in joint human‚Äìocean-world initiatives to apply learned skills in real-world scenarios.  

This course was designed to lay the foundation for a culturally rich and inclusive campus, ensuring Atlantis students feel valued and supported.

### ‚ú¥Ô∏è POV Statement 2  
**Atlantis students need effective ways to traverse and communicate in the above-water environment without compromising their physiological needs.**

To address this challenge, our team conceptualized **water-filled spacesuits** tailored to the unique needs of Atlantis students. These suits are innovative, wearable habitats that allow students to move freely on campus while remaining immersed in water. Key features include:  
- **Air Pumps**: To regulate water flow and maintain optimal breathing conditions.  
- **Pressure Control Systems**: To mimic the underwater pressures of Atlantis, ensuring comfort and safety.  
- **Sunlight Protection**: UV-resistant coatings to shield students from harmful terrestrial sunlight.  
- **Language Transmission Systems**: Integrated devices to translate aquatic vocalizations into audible speech for human interaction, fostering seamless communication.  

This solution balances functionality with practicality, enabling Atlantis students to participate fully in campus life while staying true to their aquatic nature.

### ‚ú¥Ô∏è POV Statement 3  
**Atlantis students need living and mobility solutions that allow them to thrive in the above-water environment.**

To create a supportive living environment, we proposed:  
- **Undersea Hall**: A residential facility designed to replicate the aquatic conditions of Atlantis, complete with water-filled rooms, customizable pressure settings, and bioluminescent lighting to mimic their natural habitat.  
- **Water-Filled Buses**: Specialized transportation equipped with air pumps and water circulation systems, allowing Atlantis students to travel comfortably across campus.  
- **Campus Hydration Tanks**: Strategically placed rest areas filled with water, offering spaces for Atlantis students to hydrate, relax, and socialize between classes.  

These solutions were crafted with empathy, ensuring Atlantis students could live, move, and rest in ways that honor their physiological and cultural identities.

### üß™ Learning & Execution Process

Our design process began with a collaborative **mindmapping session**, where we visualized the Atlantis students as **shark-like beings with legs**‚Äîcapable of terrestrial movement but reliant on water for breathing and communication. This vivid imagery guided our ideation, helping us empathize with their unique needs. I actively participated in sketching the mindmap, contributing ideas that shaped our POV statements and solutions. My suggestion for **OCES 1000** emerged from this process, inspired by my belief that cultural integration is the cornerstone of inclusion.

To bring our ideas to life, we iterated through multiple brainstorming sessions, refining our concepts based on feedback and feasibility. I contributed to visualizing the aquatic students‚Äô daily routines, imagining how they would navigate lecture halls, dining areas, and social spaces. This exercise deepened my understanding of **empathic design**‚Äîthe practice of designing with the user‚Äôs perspective at the forefront.

*Suggested Visual Evidence*: To strengthen this section, I plan to include an image of our team‚Äôs mindmap and a sketch of the water-filled spacesuit concept, showcasing the ideation process. Additionally, a short video or screenshot of our group‚Äôs brainstorming session (if recorded) could illustrate our collaborative dynamic.

### ü§ñ Use of AI

To enhance our brainstorming and reflection processes, I utilized **Microsoft Copilot**, a generative AI tool. During needfinding, Copilot helped generate creative prompts, such as ‚ÄúWhat would an aquatic student need to feel included in a lecture hall?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow might we adapt transportation for water-dependent beings?‚Äù These prompts sparked discussions that led to innovative ideas like the water-filled buses. In the reflection phase, Copilot assisted in organizing my thoughts and refining the wording of this portfolio, ensuring clarity and coherence. Using AI taught me how technology can augment human creativity, serving as a valuable partner in the design process.

### ü™û Personal Reflection

This project was more than an academic exercise; it was a crucible for learning that fundamentally reshaped my understanding of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). The imaginative constraint of designing for aquatic visitors from Atlantis proved to be a powerful tool, forcing me to dismantle my preconceived notions of a "user" and rebuild my design philosophy from a place of radical empathy. It taught me that the core of HCI is not just about creating efficient interfaces, but about designing with dignity, respect, and a profound curiosity for experiences far beyond my own. This process of imagining the daily life of a shark-like being‚Äîthe constant need for hydration, the challenge of communicating through water, the psychological comfort of a familiar environment‚Äîmade abstract concepts like user-centered design and accessibility viscerally real.

One of the most significant and unexpected learning moments came from a personal challenge. While I was deeply involved in the ideation and development phases, I underestimated the intensity of the presentation. When the moment came, my social anxiety created a barrier I couldn't overcome, and I was unable to speak. In that moment of intense vulnerability, I witnessed the true strength of our team. Without a moment's hesitation, my groupmates seamlessly absorbed my part, their encouragement and understanding turning what felt like a personal failure into a powerful lesson in psychological safety and collaborative support. Their kindness was a reminder that a team's success is not measured by the performance of one individual, but by its capacity to lift every member up. Standing with them, even in silence, was a personal milestone. It taught me that contributing is not always about speaking; sometimes, it‚Äôs about showing up, being present, and trusting your team.

The project also illuminated the dynamic and often chaotic beauty of the iterative design process. Our initial mindmapping session was a flurry of disparate ideas, but through collaborative refinement, we sculpted that chaos into a coherent vision. Proposing the OCES 1000 course was a particular point of pride for me. It stemmed from a core belief that technological solutions‚Äîlike our water-filled spacesuits and buses‚Äîare only half the answer. True inclusion is built on a foundation of mutual understanding and cultural exchange. The course represented the "software" for our hardware-based solutions, addressing the social and emotional needs of the Atlantis students. Seeing my teammates embrace and build upon this idea affirmed my ability to contribute meaningfully to our team's strategic direction.

Looking ahead, this project has crystallized my goals for personal and professional growth. My experience during the presentation has ignited a resolve to proactively manage my anxiety. For the next project, I will not only prepare my content but also practice my delivery, perhaps starting with a smaller speaking role to build confidence incrementally. Furthermore, I am inspired to push our team‚Äôs use of visual prototyping. While our mindmap was effective, I now see the immense value in creating more tangible artifacts‚Äîlike detailed diagrams of the Undersea Hall or a low-fidelity prototype of the spacesuit's interface‚Äîto make our ideas more compelling and testable. Project 1 was a foundational experience that has solidified my passion for a more inclusive and empathetic approach to design, and I am eager to carry these invaluable lessons into the challenges that lie ahead.
