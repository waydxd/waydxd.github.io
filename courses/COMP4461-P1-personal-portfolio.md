## 🌊 Project 1: Designing for Aquatic Visitors from Atlantis

This page serves as a personal diary and reflection space for each of the three course projects in COMP4461. It complements the overview page and provides deeper insight into my learning journey, contributions, and growth.


### 🧠 Project Description & Goal

Our challenge was to imagine how HKUST could become more inclusive and welcoming to visiting students from the aquatic kingdom of Atlantis. These students have unique physiological and cultural needs — such as requiring water to breathe and communicate — and our goal was to design solutions that support their adaptation to life on campus.

We began by creating a **mindmap** to explore ideas and needs.

**Group 5 Members**:  
CHAN, Wing Yu · FENG, Yi Cheng · IU, Hei Ching · POON Tsz Hang · ZHAO, Yu Hua  
*GenAI was used during needfinding and brainstorming.*

### ✴️ POV Statement 1  
*The students need a more inclusive campus culture to enjoy UST study and life better.*

We proposed a new Common Core course: **OCES 1000**  
- Understand cultural & species diversity  
- Learn cross-environment communication methods  
- Explore environmental adaptation strategies  
- Practice conflict resolution & cooperation  
- Share traditions through cultural exchange  
- Build empathy and mutual respect  
- Apply skills in joint human–ocean-world projects

### ✴️ POV Statement 2  
*The students need a way to traverse and communicate in the above-water environment.*

We imagined **spacesuits** filled with water, equipped with:
- Air pumps  
- Pressure control  
- Sunlight protection  
- Language transmission systems  

---

### ✴️ POV Statement 3  
*The students need a way to live in the above-water environment.*

We proposed:
- **Undersea Hall**: a living space mimicking their natural habitat  
- **Water-filled buses** with air pumps  
- **Campus tanks** for hydration and rest

## 🧪 Learning & Execution Process

We visualized the Atlantis students as **shark-like beings with legs**, capable of walking but needing water to speak. I helped draw the mindmap and contributed ideas — especially the concept for **OCES 1000**, which was my own suggestion.

## 🤖 Use of AI

I used **Microsoft Copilot** to assist with brainstorming, organizing ideas, and refining reflections.

## 💪 Personal Contributions & Achievements

- Participated in the **mind formation process**  
- Proposed the **OCES 1000** course  
- Helped visualize the aquatic students and their needs  
- Although I didn’t present due to social anxiety, I stood with my group — my legs were shaking, but I showed up.

## 🪞 Personal Reflection

I learned that preparation matters — I didn’t anticipate the presentation moment and froze. But I also realized how supportive my groupmates are, and how great they are at networking and collaboration.

This project helped me understand **empathy in design** — thinking deeply about the needs of others, especially those very different from us. It gave me a clearer sense of what **Human–Computer Interaction (HCI)** is really about.

Next time, I’ll contribute more actively and prepare better. I’m proud of what I did, and I’m growing.
