# Design I: Empathize – A Lecture Summary and Guide

Welcome to this teaching session based on the lecture notes from "Design I: Empathize" by Xiaojuan Ma (COMP4461). These notes explore design as both a practical skill and a mindset, with a focus on the "Empathize" phase of design thinking. I'll break it down step by step, following the structure of the slides, explaining key concepts, providing examples, and highlighting important takeaways. This approach emphasizes human-centered design, drawing from sources like Donald Norman's *Emotional Design* and IDEO's principles.

Think of this as an interactive lesson: I'll summarize sections, explain why they matter, and suggest reflections or activities to reinforce learning. By the end, you'll understand how to start designing with empathy for users.

## 1. The Importance of Design in Society
The lecture opens with a 2025 presidential executive order titled "Improving Our Nation Through Better Design" (from the White House). It highlights the need for government services to be "usable and beautiful," establishing "America by Design" – a national initiative to enhance digital and physical experiences. Key points:
- **Policy Goal**: Deliver efficient, beautiful experiences to improve quality of life.
- **National Design Studio**: Advises agencies on reducing costs, standardizing design for trust, and elevating public experiences.

**Why it matters**: Design isn't just aesthetic; it's practical and impactful at a societal level. Poor design (e.g., confusing government websites) erodes trust and efficiency. Reflection: Think of a poorly designed public service you've encountered – how did it affect you?

## 2. What is Design?
Design is presented in two lenses:
- **Design as a Practice**: Domain-specific, involving knowledge, skills, and tools tailored to fields like graphic design (visuals), industrial design (products), interaction design (user interfaces), or service design (holistic experiences).
- **Design as a Way of Thinking**: Generic process and mindset, applicable anywhere – focusing on empathy, iteration, and human needs.

| Aspect                  | Description                          | Examples from Notes |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Practice (Domain-Specific)** | Specialized tools and skills for creating artifacts. | Graphic: Logos, posters; Industrial: Furniture, gadgets; Interaction: Apps, websites; Service: End-to-end user journeys (e.g., banking apps to customer support). |
| **Way of Thinking (Generic)** | A mindset for problem-solving, integrating people, tech, and business. | Human-centered innovation (more on this later). |

**Teaching Tip**: Design thinking shifts from "tech-first" to "people-first." Activity: Identify a design in your daily life (e.g., your phone app) – is it more practice or thinking?

## 3. Three Levels of Design (From Donald A. Norman, *Emotional Design*, 2005)
Norman describes design at three emotional levels, affecting how users perceive and interact with products:
- **Visceral Design**: Immediate sensory appeal (look, feel, sound). E.g., The sleek iPhone design evokes excitement.
- **Behavioral Design**: Functionality and usability (does it work well?). E.g., Intuitive navigation in apps.
- **Reflective Design**: Deeper meaning and long-term experience (personal stories, cultural significance). E.g., A smartphone as a status symbol.

**Visual Example from Notes**: iOS icons for visceral (light/feel), behavioral (voice control/usability), reflective (social media meaning).

**Why it matters**: Good design balances all three – visceral draws users in, behavioral keeps them, reflective builds loyalty. Usability tip: Follow Occam's Razor – "The simplest solution is usually the best" (e.g., Google's clean search page).

## 4. Key Aspects of Design
- **Usability**: Focus on efficiency and simplicity. Example: Google's minimal interface prioritizes function over clutter.
- **Aesthetics**: "Attractive things work better" (Norman). Beautiful designs reduce cognitive load and improve perception. Example: A cluttered political website vs. a clean one – aesthetics influence trust.
- **Culture and User-Dependence**: Usability and aesthetics vary by user (e.g., Japanese websites use dense text and icons meaningful in that culture). Notes show Japanese sites with kanji-heavy layouts.

**Takeaway**: Design is subjective – balance aesthetics with goals (e.g., a heart icon for "aesthetic" vs. a target for "goals"). Reflection: How does culture affect your favorite app's design?

## 5. Design as a Way of Thinking: Design Thinking
Defined by IDEO: "A human-centered approach to innovation that integrates the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success."

- **Evolution**: It used to be about products (e.g., building tech features); now it's about people (e.g., solving user pains).
- **Video Reference**: A YouTube clip (likely on design thinking basics) emphasizes starting with users, not solutions.

**Where NOT to Start**:
- **Solution-First**: "I have a cool feature" or "Our tech is strong here" – leads to irrelevant innovations (e.g., a hammer without a nail).
- **Problem-First**: "They told me to fix this" – assumes the problem is clear, but it might not be user-validated.
- **Best Start: User Need**: "Users struggle with X" or "People want Y" – grounds design in empathy.

**Video Example**: A clip on Hong Kong's cashless adoption (only 53% tried it) shows real user needs (e.g., trust in digital payments).

**Activity**: Brainstorm a "user need" for a common issue, like remote work fatigue. Avoid jumping to solutions!

## 6. From Mindset to Process
Design thinking is iterative: **Empathize → Interpret → Ideate → Verify**.
- This lecture focuses on **Empathize**: Understand users deeply.
- Visual slides (from Slideshare) show workshops turning observations into insights.

**Preparation Before Empathizing**:
1. **Problem Scope**:
   - User Type: Age, profession, etc.
   - Context: Location, domain.
   - Goal: Productivity, wellbeing.
   - Technology: Touchscreen, wearable.
2. **Ability and Constraints**: Assess your skills/time (notes show "Z Z Z" for sleepiness – don't overcommit!).
3. **Basic Knowledge**: Learn norms, ethics, jargon (e.g., media icons for research).

**Why Prepare?**: Ensures focused, ethical empathy.

## 7. The Empathize Phase: Core Methods
Empathize means immersing in users' worlds to uncover needs. Three sub-methods:
- **Immerse**: Become "one of them" (e.g., live a day as your user).
- **Observe**: Watch without interfering.
- **Contact (Interview)**: Talk directly.

**Video References**: Clips on empathy techniques (e.g., YouTube on observation methods).

### Observe: Gathering Natural Data
- **Methods**:
  - Watch in context (e.g., people using public transport).
  - Shadow users (follow without disrupting).
  - Diaries: Self-reports (paper/digital like Google Forms).
- **Questions to Answer**: When/where/how behaviors happen, who/what's involved, feelings, why.
- **Tools**: Notes, sketches, photos/videos/audios (with consent).
- **Focus Areas**:
  - **Environment**: Location, time, weather.
  - **People**: Types (frequent/outliers), style (expressions, gestures).
  - **Behaviors**: Recurring (e.g., checking phones), changes (e.g., pausing).
  - **Dynamics**: Verbal/physical interactions.
- **Use Yourself**: Note your feelings as observer or "in their shoes."
- **Ethics**: Get consents; respect privacy/legal issues (e.g., no filming kids without permission).
- **Specific Techniques**:
  - **Monitoring**: Find a good spot, observe long-term.
  - **Shadowing**: Follow and annotate neutrally.
  - **Diaries**: Report contexts (time/location), activities (goals), participants (people/objects), feelings. Design diaries to be light/simple with reminders.

**Pros of Observation**: Objective, natural behaviors. **Cons**: Less control, hard to get "why."

**Activity**: Observe people in a café for 10 minutes – note behaviors without judging.

### Contact: The Art of Interview
- **Types**: Formal (structured questions) vs. informal (conversational); structured (fixed) vs. semi-structured (flexible).
- **Who**: Representatives ("everyone has stories"); diverse users.
- **Preparation**:
  - Script/pilot questions (share if requested).
  - Schedule with reminders/instructions.
  - Bring tools (notes, recorder).
  - Be a good listener; thank them.
- **Techniques to Make Comfortable**:
  - Convenient time/ambience.
  - Welcoming gestures.
- **Question Strategies**:
  - Ask how to address them.
  - Open-ended (not yes/no): "Tell me about..." instead of "Do you like?"
  - Probe: Demonstrations, comparisons, envisioning future.
  - Definitions/examples/anecdotes.
  - One question at a time; follow-ups.
  - Exit: "Anything else?" or recommendations.
- **Do Nots**:
  - Bias/judge/argue/add comments.
  - Keep brief, dig deeper if needed, stay focused/polite/open.
- **Video**: Likely on interview best practices.

**Pros of Interviews**: Insightful, subjective depth. **Cons**: Users omit details or bias responses.

**Activity**: Practice interviewing a friend about their daily routine – use open questions and note biases.

## 8. Tools for Empathy: Empathy Map and AI
- **Empathy Map**: A simple framework (from notes, likely a blank template):
  - What users **say/do/think/feel**?
  - Helps synthesize observations/interviews.
- **AI for Empathy**: Use tools for visual checking/building empathy (e.g., generating user personas from data).

**When to Use Methods**:
| Method     | Strengths                  | Weaknesses             |
|------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| **Observe** | Objective, natural info   | Less controllable, no "why" |
| **Interview** | Subjective insights       | Omissions, self-reported bias |

Combine them for comprehensive understanding.

## 9. Common Pitfalls in Empathizing
Avoid these to ensure valid insights:
- **Cognitive Bias** (Observer-Expectancy Effect): Your expectations shape what you see (Wikipedia link).
- **"I'll Know It When I See It"**: Vague goals lead to unfocused observation.
- **Description-Experience Gap**: Users describe differently than they experience (e.g., saying they want simple, but preferring complex).
- **Self-Discrepancy**: Gap between actual vs. ideal self affects responses (Wikipedia; video on self-discrepancy).

**Video**: Likely illustrates these biases in real scenarios.

**Tip**: Stay neutral; validate with multiple methods.

## 10. Recap: Full Design Thinking Process
From mindset to action:
- **Empathize**: Immerse/Observe (methods/tools)/Contact (interviews).
- **Interpret**: Organize data → Construct frameworks (e.g., empathy maps) → Generate Point of View (POV statements like "User needs X because Y").
- **Ideate**: Brainstorm (rules: quantity over quality, no judgment) → Mindmaps.
- **Verify**: Storyboarding → Speed dating/role-playing for quick feedback.

**Overall Flow**:
```
Empathize → Interpret → Ideate → Verify (Iterate as Needed)
```

## Final Thoughts and Questions
