### 🧭 1. The Survey Research Process

* **Purpose:** Gather insights from users in a structured, measurable way.
* **Steps:**

  1. Define goals →
  2. Choose sampling method →
  3. Design questionnaire →
  4. Pilot test →
  5. Analyze results.

---

### 👥 2. Sampling Methods

* **Non-probability sampling:**
  Uses human judgment — e.g., convenience (friends, events), expert judgment, or open web surveys.
  → *Not representative, but acceptable for exploratory studies.*
* **Probability sampling:**
  Random, systematic, stratified, or cluster sampling.
  → *Use when you want generalizable results.*

---

### 📏 3. Sample Size & Recruitment

* **Depends on:** desired accuracy, confidence level, and population size.
* **Typical sizes:**

  * Rapid prototyping → 5+ users
  * Lab user studies → moderate sample
  * A/B testing → large random samples
* **Recruitment:** through participant pools, social media, mailing lists, or posters.

---

### 📝 4. Designing the Questionnaire

* **Medium:** paper, email, or web.
* **Length:** every extra page ↓ response rate by ~5%.
* **Structure:**

  1. Title + introduction
  2. Demographics
  3. Substantive questions (your actual topic)
  4. Closing / thank you

---

### ❓ 5. Question Types

* **Open-ended:** detailed, flexible, hard to analyze.
* **Closed-ended:** faster to answer, easier to quantify.
* **Likert scales:** commonly 5–7 points (e.g., Strongly disagree → Strongly agree).

  * Odd = allows neutrality
  * Even = forces decision

---

### 🧠 6. Writing Good Questions

* Be clear and specific.
* Avoid jargon, double negatives, and bias.
* Mix positive and negative items to avoid “pattern answering.”
* Place sensitive or personal questions at the end.

---

### 🖋️ 7. Formatting Guidelines

* Keep alignment neat (answers on the right).
* Use 10pt+ font, good contrast, and consistent style.
* Do not split one question across pages.
* Include page and question numbers.

---

### 🧪 8. Pilot Testing

* Check **completeness, clarity, and technical issues** (esp. for web forms).
* Test on different devices/browsers.
* Look for confusing wording or missing options.

---

### ⚠️ 9. Bias & Validity

* **Response bias:** question order, emotional state, or context can skew answers.
* **Reliability:** consistent results under similar conditions.
* **Validity:** actually measures what you intend.
  → Achieve by clear wording and shared understanding.

---

### 🧩 10. Human Ability & Personality Testing

* Evaluate human factors like:

  * **Sensory** (vision, hearing)
  * **Motor** (coordination)
  * **Cognitive** (attention, memory)
  * **Language/Literacy** (comprehension)
  * **Personality** (e.g., Big Five, MBTI)
* Use **standardized tests** for consistency (e.g., TOEFL, WRAT, Health Literacy).

### 🧾 11. Key Takeaway

> A **good questionnaire** is short, clear, unbiased, and reliable.
> It captures the *right* information from the *right* people — efficiently and ethically.
